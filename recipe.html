				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<h3>Step 1</h3>
					<li class="list blue">Make the sauce by putting all the sauce ingredients into a blender and give it a few whizzes to thoroughly combine. Pour into dipping bowls. Set aside. The recipe makes about 1/2 cup of sauce, which is plenty. Even with my aggressive dunking there is normally leftover for salad on another day. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep1.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 2</h3>
					<li class="list green">Prepare (wash, trim) avocado and all the veggies you want to use in your rolls. Cut things small and somewhat long in shape, or grate it. It makes rolling a lot easier. Very thin & flexible items like the dark green perilla leaves pictured (or kale for example) roll easily if you trim off the spine. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep2.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 3</h3>
					<li class="list blue">In terms of the rice paper, don't confuse them with "spring roll" wrappers, even though some people call these types of rolls "rainbow spring rolls". They are NOT the same thing! The ingredients should be rice, salt & water. They are hard & brittle and require a quick soak in warm water before using. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep3.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 4</h3>
					<li class="list green">First soak one rice paper in warm water. I like heated kettle water say, the temperature of a warm shower. Soak for ~25-30 sec. Keep feeling it. It should be pliable but not soggy - it softens a bit more as you pile on the fillings. I like to start with soft leaves & avo, and continue from there. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep4.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 5</h3>
					<li class="list blue">Load it on! You'll figure out quickly what is too little (limp looking rolls) and what is too much (the rice paper rips). Get creative with your fillings..besides veggies, tofu & cooked vermicelli noodles are terrific too! <img src="images/recipe/recipestep5.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 6</h3>
					<li class="list green">1.Flip bottom partway up 2.Using hands on both sides, roll up while gently squeezing & tucking the rice paper under the filling 3.Press down to prevent filling from shifting and 4.flip up the end to secure. Repeat other side 5.Continue rolling with same gentle squeeze-tuck 6.Roll rest of the way up. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep6.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 7</h3>
					<li class="list blue">Ta-da! <img src="images/recipe/recipestep7.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 8</h3>
					<li class="list green">Using a very sharp knife, cut roll into 2 pieces. <img src="images/recipe/recipestep8.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 9</h3>
					<li class="list blue">So pretty! Ignoring the cartoon bandaid on my thumb ðŸ¤“ <img src="images/recipe/recipestep9.jpg"></li>

					<h3>Step 10</h3>
					<li class="list green">Here is a video of me rolling one from start to finish in real time...not! ðŸ˜… <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  					<source src="images/recipe/recipestep10.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></li>

					<h3>Step 11</h3>
					<li class="list blue">Dip dip dip away! The tahini sauce is hecka good. I hope you enjoy it too :) <img src="images/recipe/recipestep11.jpg"></li>
